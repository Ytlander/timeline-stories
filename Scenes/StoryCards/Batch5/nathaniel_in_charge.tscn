body = "Nathaniel watched Sarah slump to the side and didn't realize what was happening. He ran up to check on her, she was breathing and seemed to be asleep.
[left]\"What's happening to her!?\" Nathaniel asked Matthew with panic in his voice.[/left]
\"Looks like she's sleeping\" Matthew said. \"I think I'll take a little nap myself, nightie night!\" and with that he giggled and closed his eyes.
\"Guys!?\" Nathaniel yelled at Rose and Theo but they didn't hear him over the banging of the locker against the doors. \"Guys, stop!\" they finally heard him and stopped their work. Nathaniel pointed at Sarah and Matthew and explained what had happened.
[left]\"It sounds like they were drugged\" Rose said. \"But who would do that?\"[/left]

[left]A sinking feeling spread through Nathaniel.[/left]

\"It must have been Matthew, you heard them both arguing before, and they both drank from the bottle he brought\" Nathaniel said and walked over to the bottle and picked it up, smelling it's contents.
[left]\"I don't think you can smell it buddy\" Theo said
\"It definitely was this though\" Nathaniel said. \"He poisoned her\"[/left]"
