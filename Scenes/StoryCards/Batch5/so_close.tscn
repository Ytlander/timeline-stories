\"Please, just let me do it.\" Matthew pleaded with the others. Again silence took it's place among the group. Theo fidgeted with the shotgun in his hands. Finally Rose started talking.
\"I think we should let him work. If Peter actually made it then maybe Matthew can save both him and Maria.\"
\"I think I can, look it's all here.\" Matthew had entered the room and picked up the instructions for how to mix the cure that lay beside the note. The others looked at each other and nodded.
\"We'll let you work, under strict supervision, we know what you did to Sarah and you will have to answer for it later.\" Nathaniel said.
