body = "Peter loved his wife Maria. Loved her for the way she talked, those rolling r’s which was the only thing revealing her accent. The smile she wore even through these dark times and her jokes that could make everyone in the room laugh. He loved the smell of her as he snuggled close to her at night but most of all, right now, he loved her for her brain. 

When they met she was already a brilliant scientist, but the research they had done together for the last three years would never have reached near any of the heights it had if it wasn’t for her. They were so close to a breakthrough and the last two weeks, the work that Maria had done, was what had gotten them to this point."
