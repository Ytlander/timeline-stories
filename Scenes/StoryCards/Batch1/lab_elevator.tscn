body = "The sample elevators was his ticket to get the alcohol into Maria's lab. The facility had labs on multiple floors and some were connected with a small elevator for sending samples between them. He ran as quickly as he could to the lab that lay below Maria's that had such an elevator.

When he got inside he opened the supplies closet and scanned the shelves. On the top one he found the medicinal alcohol. Standing on his toes he could just reach and grab a bottle. He loaded the elevator with it and pressed the button to send it up to Peter.

He returned to the guard room and as he got there Peter had already continued his work. Matthew let out a small sigh of relief but knew that his work was not over yet. He needed to buy time for Peter and as he watched the double doors bulge inwards from the smashing it received from Sarah's home made battering ram, he knew what he had to do. He would have to betray Sarah."
