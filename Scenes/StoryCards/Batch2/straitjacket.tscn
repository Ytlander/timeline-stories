body = "Maria's eyes were bloodshot and she was foaming at the mouth. She had all the symptoms, including the twitches, she was a zombie and the realization spread like ice through Peter's body. Maria lunged for him again but this time he was ready for her and got his lab coat, oversized for her, to slip over her outstretched arms as she ran toward him. He stepped to the side, holding on to both ends of the sleeves and pulled them tight behind her back, tying them together like a straitjacket. In the back of the lab they had a small cupboard for cleaning supplies, nothing crucial, but it had a lock and a door sturdy enough to contain the raving love of his life. Peter prodded and pushed her in there, being careful enough to avoid her snapping jaws. When she was finally inside he quickly closed the door and locked it.

He could finally catch his breath and tend to the wound on his neck. Lucky for him it wasn't deep and he could dress it himself. He set the alarm on his watch to twelve hours. That was the time he had left so he better make the most of it. They were so close to a breakthrough, Peter hoped that his mind alone would be enough, now that his better half, and the better brain, was taken over by the virus.
