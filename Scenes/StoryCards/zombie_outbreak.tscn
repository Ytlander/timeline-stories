body = "Sarah was standing in the guard room in front of the surveillance screens. She wore a spotless dark blue uniform with the guard captain insignia on the left side of her chest. What she was witnessing had her in disbelief, how could it happen, here and now? They had taken every precaution, the rangers were kept in quarantine for twenty four hours when coming back from assignments and the scientists always worked with the proper protection equipment when handling the infected rats.

Sarah swore under her breath and collected her racing thoughts. Even if Maria and Peter were lost to the sickness there where many that could still be saved. By her side stood her life long friend Matthew who was working in the labs together with Maria and Peter, he had stopped by the guard room to share his morning coffee with Sarah as he so often did.

\"Nathaniel, get Rose and Theo and bring shotguns. I'll meet you outside Marias lab\". Nathaniel had the same uniform, not as perfect as Sarahs though, and he wore the standard guard insignia.
\"Yes, ma'am!\" he answered Sarah and left the room."
